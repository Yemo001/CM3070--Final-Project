# 📈 Predictive Modelling of Social Media Trend Emergence  
🎓 **Final Year Project (CM3070)**

---

## 🌟 Overview
This project explores whether **early-stage metadata and lightweight content signals** can be used to predict the **emergence of trending short-form video content**.

The study focuses on a comparison between **YouTube Shorts** and **TikTok Shorts**, analysing how different platform formats and early engagement signals influence trend formation.

📚 This work was completed as a **Final Year Project** for the  
**BSc (Hons) Computer Science — University of London**,  
studied via **SIM (distance learning)**, with academic direction provided by **Goldsmiths, University of London**.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Short-form video trends emerge extremely quickly — often within hours or days.

This project investigates:

> **Can early observable metadata be used to predict whether a short-form video will become trending?**

Instead of relying on long-term engagement history, the focus is on **early-stage signals**, reflecting realistic constraints faced in real-world prediction scenarios.

---

## 📊 Data Sources
- 📺 **YouTube Shorts** — collected using the *YouTube Data API*
- 🎵 **TikTok Shorts** — sourced from publicly available datasets (Kaggle)

🗺️ Data is scoped to the **United States region** and covers content from the **past 2–3 years** to ensure relevance and consistency.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 🔄 1. Data Pipeline
An end-to-end academic data pipeline was designed and implemented, covering:
- Data collection & ingestion  
- Validation and cleaning  
- Feature extraction & preprocessing  
- Train/test splitting  
- Model training and evaluation  

The pipeline was structured to simulate **real-world data workflows**, including handling missing values, noisy data, and class imbalance.

---

### 🧩 2. Feature Engineering
Features were derived from:
- Early engagement metrics (views, likes, comments)
- Video metadata (duration, posting time, category)
- Textual features from titles/descriptions using **TF-IDF**

⚖️ Class imbalance was addressed using **SMOTE**, and feature importance analysis was performed to identify key predictive signals.

---

### 🤖 3. Models Implemented
The following models were trained and compared:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  

📏 Evaluation metrics:
- F1-score  
- Precision & Recall  
- Confusion Matrix  

This enabled comparison between interpretable baselines and more complex ensemble models.

---

## 📈 Results & Evaluation
- Models achieved **moderate predictive performance** using early-stage features alone.
- Tree-based models (**Random Forest, XGBoost**) generally outperformed linear baselines.
- Differences were observed between **YouTube Shorts and TikTok Shorts**, suggesting platform-specific trend dynamics.
- Results highlight both the **potential and limitations** of early trend prediction.

A detailed evaluation and discussion of limitations is included in the final report.

⚠️ Limitations

API rate limits constrained data volume

TikTok data sourced from public datasets (no live API access)

Trend labels depend on platform-specific definitions

Results are exploratory and academic in nature

All limitations are discussed transparently in the report.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience in:

Designing structured data pipelines

Working with noisy, real-world datasets

Feature engineering and model comparison

Handling class imbalance in ML tasks

Documenting system design, assumptions, and limitations
