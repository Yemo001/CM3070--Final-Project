# CM3070--Final-Project

# This is the notebook and reports for various submitted works throughout my FYP Data Science Project.

Overview

This repository contains all code, figures and reports for my BSc CS Final Year Project (UoL/Goldsmiths).
The project builds a lightweight, interpretable pipeline to predict trend emergence on YouTube Shorts using only early-available metadata (publish time, title, views/likes/comments) rather than full content analysis.
